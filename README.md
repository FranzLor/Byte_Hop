There are a total of 8 different types of areas. After the starting areas, and as the player progresses, the map will be randomly generated based off those 8 areas.

 
**Dynamic Map**<br>
There is a day-and-night cycle. This aims to increase the difficulty for the player.


**Customization Shop**<br>
The game includes a skin shop that gives the player incentive on the CPU that they collect. There are 3 styles they can choose from.

 
**Stat Tracking**<br>
The player will be able to see stats based off their performance. Stats such as highest distance achieved, lifetime deaths, and more.
